Automated Soil Moisture Monitoring and Irrigation System
This project implements an Arduino-based soil moisture monitoring and automated irrigation system using a soil moisture sensor, relay-controlled water pump, and LED indicators. The system ensures efficient water management by automatically activating irrigation when soil moisture falls below a predefined threshold.

📌 Features
Real-time soil moisture monitoring using an analog sensor.
Automatic motor control via a relay switch.
LED indicators for system status:
Red LED → Low moisture (Motor ON)
Green LED → Sufficient moisture (Motor OFF)
Prevents overwatering by stopping irrigation once the moisture level reaches the threshold.

🔧 Hardware Components
Component	Description
Arduino Uno	Microcontroller unit for processing sensor data and controlling outputs.
Soil Moisture Sensor	Analog sensor to measure soil water content.
5V Relay Module	Controls the motor (water pump) based on moisture readings.
Water Pump (Motor)	Provides irrigation when soil moisture is low.
Red LED	Indicates dry soil, motor activation.
Green LED	Indicates sufficient moisture, motor deactivation.
Power Supply (5V/12V)	Required to operate the system.

📜 System Architecture & Working Principle
The Soil Moisture Sensor continuously measures soil water content and transmits an analog signal to the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino processes the input signal and compares it with a predefined threshold value (calibrated for different soil types).
Based on the moisture level:
If moisture < threshold → The relay is activated, the water pump starts, and the red LED turns ON.
If moisture ≥ threshold → The relay is deactivated, the water pump stops, and the green LED turns ON.
The system operates in real-time, ensuring an optimal irrigation cycle without manual intervention.

int moistureValue = 0;  // Stores soil moisture sensor readings
const int THRESHOLD = 400; // Define threshold based on soil conditions

    // Read soil moisture level
    moistureValue = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);
    Serial.print("Soil Moisture Level: ");
    Serial.println(moistureValue);

    // Decision Making Logic
    if (moistureValue < THRESHOLD) {  // Soil is dry
        digitalWrite(MOTOR_PIN, HIGH); // Activate relay (start pump)
        digitalWrite(RED_LED, HIGH);   // Turn ON red LED
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, LOW);  // Turn OFF green LED
    } else {  // Soil moisture is sufficient
        digitalWrite(MOTOR_PIN, LOW);  // Deactivate relay (stop pump)
        digitalWrite(RED_LED, LOW);    // Turn OFF red LED
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, HIGH); // Turn ON green LED
